## How to run
After cloning the repo, ensure you've updated all Maven dependencies.
Open the project on your IDE of preference and run the main class.

## Disclaimer
As this is a learning project, the code is not production ready.
Many classes are not properly documented and the code could be improved in many ways.

This repository will be read only in the future, as I'm not planning to continue working on it.
